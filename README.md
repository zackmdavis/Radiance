# Radiance

Radiance is an educational neural networks library and autodifferentiation framework!

### TODO next

### big

 * LayerNorm

#### small

 * address input _vs._ args inconsistent naming infelicity
 * ignored arguments in backward pass are sketchy
 * numerically stabler softmax
 * reduce Origin boilerplate (more complicated than it looks; `Self {}` is not a legal constructor)
