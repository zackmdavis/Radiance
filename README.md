### TODO next

### big

 * `Softmax` `Operation`
 * `Mask` `Operation` probably?
 * build scaled dot-product attention from MatrixMultiplication, Multiplication, Mask, Softmax Operations??
   * https://paperswithcode.com/method/scaled

#### small

 * address TensorBuilder identifier infelicity
 * address `requires_gradient` dubious default infelicity
 * address input _vs._ args inconsistent naming infelicity
